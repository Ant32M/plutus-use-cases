# NFT Marketplace

Frontend part of NFT-case implementation. 

## Installation

Firstly, go to the directory below.

```bash
./eleks/nft/market-web-app
```

Then run this command to install all needed for the project packages.

```bash
npm install
```

## Setting up IPFS
We can upload file to IPFS storage for storing NFT's associated file directly from the client side without server API endpoint.
For this purpose we will use free service provided by https://nft.storage

Create an account on the nft.storage service and generate an API access key.
Replace the acquired key for the IPFS_API_TOKEN constant in the file :
```bash
./eleks/nft/market-web-app/src/helpers/constants.js
```



## Run app
Run this command to run the application. The app will run on **:3000** port.

```bash 
npm start
```

## Open in browser
You need to enable cross-origin policies in the browser for local app development. For example, you can open Google Chrome with this command.

```bash 
open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_test" --disable-web-security
```

## Set wallets
You need to set on frontend part right wallets ids.
Wallets ids can be found here:

```bash
./eleks/nft
```
